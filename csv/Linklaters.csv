18,0.864115,analytical,Analytical,"1. Industrial processes – chemical hydrogen Hydrogen has been used for decades in industrial processes such as oil refining, ammonia production and iron and steel production, however it is currently almost exclusively produced from unabated carbon-containing fossil fuels (so-called “grey hydrogen”).",18
19,0.683494,analytical,Analytical,"To give a sense of scale, approximately 6% of global natural gas production and 2% of global coal production is dedicated to grey hydrogen production (in each case, with the redundant CO2 from the fossil source largely being discharged into the atmosphere).",19

11,0.504621,joy,Joy,There is clearly enormous global excitement around its potential.,12
12,0.506763,analytical,Analytical,Governments and industry alike are focussed on clean hydrogen’s unique potential to meet the world’s energy needs across a range of different use cases.,13
13,0.60774,analytical,Analytical,"As we have explored, for this potential to be fully realised, it requires: >	the ambition and capacity at government level to identify and pursue the supply sources and use cases that best meet their specific political objectives and are deliverable; >	the creation of clear and cohesive policies to incentivise the use cases and unlock both supply and demand, and which will enable the transition to a functioning liquid market on both a national and cross-border basis; >	unblocking the regulatory, infrastructure, safety and transportation challenges that come with the creation of a new energy vector; and >	international co-ordination and co-operation in relation to standards, certification and transportation.",14
